// ========== MOTOR SELECTION FAQs ==========
export const MOTOR_SELECTION_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What happens if I choose too little horsepower?",
    answer: "Underpowering your boat leads to poor performance, difficulty handling rough conditions, excessive engine strain, and higher fuel consumption as the motor works harder to move the boat."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I exceed my boat's maximum HP rating?",
    answer: "No. The maximum HP rating is set by Transport Canada for safety reasons. Exceeding it can void insurance, create handling problems, and put you and passengers at risk."
  },
  {
    question: "Does higher horsepower always mean faster speed?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. Hull design, weight, and propeller selection all affect speed. A properly matched motor with the right prop often outperforms an oversized motor with poor setup."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find my boat's maximum HP rating?",
    answer: "Check the capacity plate, usually located near the helm or transom. It shows maximum HP, passenger capacity, and weight limits."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the sweet spot for HP selection?",
    answer: "For most recreational boaters, we recommend 70-80% of maximum rated horsepower. This provides excellent fuel efficiency, good performance, reduced engine strain, and lower operating costs."
  },
  {
    question: "75HP, 90HP, or 115HP - which should I choose?",
    answer: "It depends on your boat and use. 75HP is great for light loads and fuel economy. 90HP is the sweet spot for versatility. 115HP is best if you haul heavy loads or need more speed. Always check your boat's max HP rating."

// ========== MAINTENANCE FAQs ==========
export const MAINTENANCE_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How often should I change the oil in my Mercury 4-stroke?",
    answer: "Change oil every 100 hours of operation or annually, whichever comes first. For new motors, the first oil change should be at 20 hours to remove break-in contaminants."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don't winterize my outboard?",
    answer: "Water left in the cooling system can freeze and crack the engine block or powerhead. Unstabilized fuel causes carburetor gumming and fuel system problems. Improper storage leads to corrosion and seal damage."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I do my own maintenance?",
    answer: "Basic tasks like oil checks, propeller inspection, and battery maintenance are DIY-friendly. However, we recommend professional service for water pump replacement, lower unit service, and annual inspections."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my water pump needs replacing?",
    answer: "Watch for weak or inconsistent water stream from the telltale, overheating warnings, or if it's been more than 300 hours since last replacement. When in doubt, have it inspected."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I replace spark plugs?",
    answer: "Every 100 hours or as part of annual service. Sooner if experiencing starting issues or rough running. Use only Mercury-approved plugs."
  },
  {
    question: "What oil should I use?",
    answer: "Mercury 4-Stroke Marine Oil (10W-30 for most applications). Mercury Full Synthetic for high-performance or Verado. Never use automotive oil."
  }
];

// ========== REPOWERING FAQs ==========
export const REPOWER_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How do I know if my boat is worth repowering?",
    answer: "If your hull, transom, and interior are in good condition, repowering almost always makes sense. We assess transom integrity and overall boat condition before recommending a repower."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I increase HP when repowering?",
    answer: "Often yes, up to your boat's maximum rated HP. Modern motors are lighter and more efficient, so a higher HP motor may work well where it wouldn't have before."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need new controls when repowering?",
    answer: "Not always. If your controls are 2004 or newer Mercury controls, they're likely compatible. Older controls may need replacement."
  },
  {
    question: "What warranty comes with a repower?",
    answer: "New Mercury motors come with full factory warranty—typically 3 years for recreational use, with options to extend up to 8 years. The warranty covers the new motor regardless of boat age."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my old aluminum boat worth repowering?",
    answer: "If the hull is solid and the transom isn't soft, almost certainly yes. Aluminum boats can last 40+ years with proper care. Repowering extends their life indefinitely."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to my old motor?",
    answer: "We can dispose of it properly, or you may trade it in for credit if it has value. Some older motors are still worth rebuilding."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a repower take?",
    answer: "Typically 3-5 days for a straightforward repower. Winter scheduling often allows faster turnaround than busy summer months."
  }

// ========== MOTOR COMPARISON FAQs ==========
export const COMPARISON_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Is Verado worth the extra cost?",
    answer: "For premium boats and demanding applications, yes. Verado offers superior refinement, quieter operation, and advanced features. However, for most recreational use, FourStroke provides excellent value without the premium price."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the main advantage of Pro XS over FourStroke?",
    answer: "Pro XS motors are lighter and tuned for higher RPM and faster acceleration. They're designed for performance-focused boaters, especially tournament anglers who need to reach fishing spots quickly."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a SeaPro for recreational boating?",
    answer: "Absolutely. SeaPro motors are built tough for commercial use, but many recreational boaters choose them for their durability. Excellent choice if you boat frequently and want maximum reliability."
  },
  {
    question: "Which Mercury motor is quietest?",
    answer: "Verado is the quietest Mercury outboard, featuring advanced sound dampening and smooth supercharged operation. FourStroke motors are also notably quiet, while Pro XS prioritizes performance over noise reduction."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Verado more reliable than FourStroke?",
    answer: "Both are extremely reliable. Verado has more complex systems (supercharger, DTS), but Mercury engineering is excellent. Proper maintenance keeps either running for decades."

// ========== NEW OWNER TIPS ==========
export const NEW_OWNER_TIPS = [
  {
    topic: "Break-In Procedure",
    tip: "The first 10 hours are critical. First hour: stay below 3000 RPM with varying speeds. Hours 2-3: gradually increase to 3/4 throttle. Hours 4-10: normal operation with varied speeds. Never hold steady throttle for extended periods during break-in."
  },
  {
    topic: "First Oil Change",
    tip: "Schedule your first oil change at 20 hours—this is critical. The oil captures metal particles from the break-in process that need to be removed before they cause wear."
  },
  {
    topic: "Break-In Don'ts",
    tip: "Don't run at constant speed for extended periods, don't immediately run at full throttle, don't let the engine overheat, don't skip the first oil change, and don't use non-marine oil."
