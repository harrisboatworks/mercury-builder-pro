# DealerSpike XML Integration for Mercury Outboard Motors

## Overview
The scraper now prioritizes DealerSpike XML feed for inventory discovery, with fallback to enhanced page scraping.

## Filters Applied
Only records that meet ALL criteria are processed:
1. **Mercury Brand**: Must be Mercury branded
2. **New Condition**: Excludes used/pre-owned inventory
3. **Outboard Motors**: Filters out boats, trailers, PWCs, parts, and accessories

## Manual Testing Commands

### Discovery Mode (XML first, pages fallback)
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -d '{"mode":"discovery"}'
```

### Full Run (Small Batch - Gentle)
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
