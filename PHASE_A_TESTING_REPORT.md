### ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL TESTING: Application Flow

**Components Verified:**
- ✅ Step 1: `PurchaseDetailsStep.tsx` - Purchase info form
- ✅ Step 2: `ApplicantStep.tsx` - Personal information  
- ✅ Step 3: `EmploymentStep.tsx` - Employment details
- ✅ Step 4: `FinancialStep.tsx` - Financial information
- ✅ Step 5: `CoApplicantStep.tsx` - Optional co-applicant
- ✅ Step 6: `ReferencesStep.tsx` - References (2 required)
- ✅ Step 7: `ReviewSubmitStep.tsx` - Review and submit

**Context & State Management:**
- ✅ `FinancingContext` provides state management
- ✅ Auto-save to localStorage (30-second intervals)
- ✅ `saveToDatabase()` function for database persistence
- ✅ Step validation and navigation control

**What Needs Manual Testing:**
1. Complete a full application (Steps 1-7)
2. Test validation rules on each step
3. Test Back/Next navigation between steps
4. Verify data persists when navigating
5. Submit application and check database entry
6. Verify success page displays correctly

---

### ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL TESTING: Save & Resume Functionality

**Edge Functions Verified:**
- ✅ `send-financing-resume-email` - Registered in `config.toml`
- ✅ `send-financing-confirmation-email` - Registered in `config.toml`

**Components Verified:**
- ✅ `SaveForLaterDialog.tsx` - Save dialog with email input
- ✅ `FinancingResume.tsx` - Resume page with token validation

**Database Fields:**
- ✅ `resume_token` column (unique token per application)
- ✅ `resume_expires_at` column (30-day expiration)

**What Needs Manual Testing:**
1. Click "Save & Continue Later" button
2. Enter email address and submit
3. Check email inbox for resume link
4. Open resume link in new browser
5. Verify application loads with saved data
6. Test token expiration handling
7. Test already-submitted application blocking

---

### ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL TESTING: Email Delivery

**Edge Functions to Test:**

**1. Resume Application Email**
- **Trigger:** Click "Save & Continue Later"
- **Recipient:** User's provided email
- **Expected:** Email with resume link, progress %, 30-day expiration

**2. Applicant Confirmation Email**
- **Trigger:** Submit complete application
- **Recipient:** Applicant's email  
- **Expected:** Confirmation with application ID, next steps

**3. Admin Notification Email**
- **Trigger:** Submit complete application
- **Recipient:** Admin/sales team
- **Expected:** New application alert with applicant info

**What to Verify:**
- Email delivery time < 1 minute
- Professional formatting and branding
- All links work correctly
- SIN is masked in admin emails

---

### 🔒 Security Audit Results

**Database Linter:** 50 warnings, 0 critical errors

**Key Findings:**
1. **Function Search Path Warnings (6 instances)** - Low priority
   - Some database functions missing `SET search_path = ''` 
   - Does not impact security, but should be fixed per best practices
   
2. **Anonymous Access Policies** - Expected behavior
   - `financing_applications` allows insert for non-authenticated users
   - This is intentional for the public application flow
   - RLS policies properly restrict viewing to admin/owner

**Recommendation:** Address function search path warnings in future security hardening phase.
